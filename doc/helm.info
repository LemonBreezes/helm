1.1.1 Modes in library ‘helm’
-----------------------------

other-mode-p
............

‘helm-major-mode’

     [INTERNAL] Provide major-mode name in Helm buffers.  Unuseful when
     used outside Helm, don’t use it.

     This mode runs the hook ‘helm-major-mode-hook’, as the final or
     penultimate step during initialization.

     \{helm-major-mode-map}

minor-mode-p
............

‘helm--minor-mode’

     (helm–minor-mode &optional ARG)

     [INTERNAL] Enable keymap in Helm minibuffer.  Since this mode has
     no effect when run outside of Helm context, please don’t use it
     outside of Helm.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm- minor mode’.  If the prefix
     argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

     \{helm-map}

‘helm--remap-mouse-mode’

     (helm–remap-mouse-mode &optional ARG)

     [INTERNAL] Prevent escaping helm minibuffer with mouse clicks.  Do
     nothing when used outside of helm context.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm--Remap-Mouse mode’.  If the
     prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

     WARNING: Do not use this mode yourself, it is internal to Helm.

‘helm-autoresize-mode’

     (helm-autoresize-mode &optional ARG)

     Auto resize helm window when enabled.  Helm window is re-sized
     according to ‘helm-autoresize-max-height’ and
     ‘helm-autoresize-min-height’.  Note that when this mode is enabled,
     Helm behaves as if ‘helm-always-two-windows’ is enabled.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm-Autoresize mode’.  If the
     prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

     See ‘fit-window-to-buffer’ for more infos.

1.1.2 Commands in keymap ‘helm-map’
-----------------------------------

Most Important
..............

‘C-g’ (‘helm-keyboard-quit’)

     Quit minibuffer in helm.  If action buffer is displayed, kill it.

‘<RET>’ (‘helm-maybe-exit-minibuffer’)

‘C-j’ (‘helm-execute-persistent-action’)

     (helm-execute-persistent-action &optional ATTR SPLIT)

     Perform the associated action ATTR without quitting helm.

     Arg ATTR default will be ‘persistent-action’ or
     ‘persistent-action-if’ if unspecified depending on what’s found in
     source, but it can be anything else.  In this case you have to add
     this new attribute to your source.  See ‘persistent-action’ and
     ‘persistent-action-if’ slot documentation in ‘helm-source’.

     When ‘helm-full-frame’ is non-nil, and ‘helm-buffer’ is displayed
     in only one window, the helm window is split to display
     ‘helm-select-persistent-action-window’ in other window to maintain
     visibility.  The argument SPLIT can be used to force splitting
     inconditionally, it is unused actually.

‘<TAB>’ (‘helm-select-action’)

     Select an action for the currently selected candidate.  If action
     buffer is selected, back to the Helm buffer.

‘C-x 1’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+1’)

‘C-c 1’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+1’)

‘C-x 2’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+2’)

‘C-c 2’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+2’)

‘C-x 3’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+3’)

‘C-c 3’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+3’)

‘C-x 4’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+4’)

‘C-c 4’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+4’)

‘C-x 5’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+5’)

‘C-c 5’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+5’)

‘C-x 6’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+6’)

‘C-c 6’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+6’)

‘C-x 7’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+7’)

‘C-c 7’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+7’)

‘C-x 8’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+8’)

‘C-c 8’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+8’)

‘C-x 9’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+9’)

‘C-c 9’ (‘helm-execute-selection-action-at-nth-+9’)

‘C-<tab>’

‘C-s’

‘C-h h’

‘C-h C-h’

‘M-s’ (‘undefined’)

     Beep to tell the user this binding is undefined.

‘C-k’ (‘helm-delete-minibuffer-contents’)

     (helm-delete-minibuffer-contents &optional ARG)

     Delete minibuffer contents.  When
     ‘helm-delete-minibuffer-contents-from-point’ is non-nil, delete
     minibuffer contents from point instead of deleting all.  With a
     prefix arg reverse this behaviour.  When at the end of minibuffer,
     delete all.

‘<help> m’

‘C-h m’

‘C-c ?’ (‘helm-help’)

     Generate Helm’s help according to ‘help-message’ attribute.

     If ‘helm-buffer’ is empty, provide completions on ‘helm-sources’ to
     choose its local documentation.  If source doesn’t have any
     ‘help-message’ attribute, a generic message explaining this is
     added instead.  The global ‘helm-help-message’ is always added
     after this local help.

‘C-h c’ (‘helm-customize-group’)

     Jump to customization group of current source.

     Default to Helm group when group is not defined in source.

Minor Modes
...........

‘C-c l’ (‘helm-display-line-numbers-mode’)

     (helm-display-line-numbers-mode &optional ARG)

     Toggle display of line numbers in current Helm buffer.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm-Display-Line-Numbers mode’.
     If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is
     zero or negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

‘C-c C-f’ (‘helm-follow-mode’)

     (helm-follow-mode &optional ARG)

     Execute persistent action every time the cursor is moved.

     This mode is source local, i.e.  It applies on current source only.
     \<helm-map> This mode can be enabled or disabled interactively at
     anytime during a helm session with \[helm-follow-mode].

     When enabling interactively ‘helm-follow-mode’ in a source, you can
     keep it enabled for next Emacs sessions by setting
     ‘helm-follow-mode-persistent’ to a non-nil value.

     When ‘helm-follow-mode’ is called with a prefix arg and
     ‘helm-follow-mode-persistent’ is non-nil ‘helm-follow-mode’ will be
     persistent only for this Emacs session, but not for the next Emacs
     sessions, i.e.  the current source will not be saved to
     ‘helm-source-names-using-follow’.

     A prefix arg with ‘helm-follow-mode’ already enabled will have no
     effect.

     Note that you can use instead of this mode the commands
     ‘helm-follow-action-forward’ and ‘helm-follow-action-backward’ at
     anytime in all Helm sessions.

     They are bound by default to \[helm-follow-action-forward] and
     \[helm-follow-action-backward].

‘C-t’ (‘helm-toggle-resplit-and-swap-windows’)

     Multi key command to re-split and swap Helm window.  First call
     runs ‘helm-toggle-resplit-window’, and second call within 1s runs

1.1.4 Options in library ‘helm’
-------------------------------

Min
...

‘helm-tramp-connection-min-time-diff’

     *Standard Value*: 5

     Value of ‘tramp-connection-min-time-diff’ for Helm remote
     processes.  If set to zero Helm remote processes are not delayed.

     Setting this to a value less than 5 or disabling it with a zero
     value is risky, however on Emacs versions starting at 24.5 it seems
     it is now possible to disable it.

     Anyway at any time in Helm you can suspend your processes while
     typing by hitting ‘C-!’.

     Only async sources than use a sentinel calling
     ‘helm-process-deferred-sentinel-hook’ are affected by this.

Windows
.......

‘helm-always-two-windows’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     When non-nil Helm uses two windows in this frame.

     I.e.  ‘helm-buffer’ in one window and ‘helm-current-buffer’ in the
     other.

     Note: this has no effect when ‘helm-split-window-inside-p’ is
     non-nil, or when ‘helm-split-window-default-side’ is set to ’same.

     When ‘helm-autoresize-mode’ is enabled, setting this to nil will
     have no effect.

     Also when non-nil it overrides the effect of
     ‘helm-split-window-default-side’ set to ‘other’.

Functions
.........

‘helm-save-configuration-functions’

     *Standard Value*:

          (set-window-configuration . current-window-configuration)

     Functions used to restore or save configurations for frames and
     windows.  Specified as a pair of functions, where car is the
     restore function and cdr is the save function.

     To save and restore frame configuration, set this variable to
     ’(set-frame-configuration .  current-frame-configuration)

     NOTE: This may not work properly with own-frame minibuffer
     settings.  Older versions saves/restores frame configuration, but
     the default has changed now to avoid flickering.

Candidate
.........

‘helm-candidate-number-limit’

     *Standard Value*: 100

     Global limit for number of candidates displayed.  When the pattern
     is empty, the number of candidates shown will be as set here
     instead of the entire list, which may be hundreds or thousands.
     Since narrowing and filtering rapidly reduces available candidates,
     having a small list will keep the interface responsive.

     Set this value to nil for no limit.

‘helm-candidate-separator’

     *Standard Value*: ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

     Candidates separator of ‘multiline’ source.

Minibuffer
..........

‘helm-delete-minibuffer-contents-from-point’

     *Standard Value*: t

     When non-nil, ‘helm-delete-minibuffer-contents’ deletes region from
     ‘point’.  Otherwise it deletes ‘minibuffer-contents’.  See
     documentation for ‘helm-delete-minibuffer-contents’.

‘helm-prevent-escaping-from-minibuffer’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Prevent escaping from minibuffer with ‘other-window’ during the
     Helm session.

Width
.....

‘helm-left-margin-width’

     *Standard Value*: 0

     ‘left-margin-width’ value for the ‘helm-buffer’.

Delay
.....

‘helm-cycle-resume-delay’

     *Standard Value*: 1.0

     Delay used before resuming in ‘helm-run-cycle-resume’.

‘helm-exit-idle-delay’

     *Standard Value*: 0

     Idle time before exiting minibuffer while Helm is updating.  Has no
     affect when helm-buffer is up to date (i.e.  exit without delay in
     this condition).

Mouse
.....

‘helm-allow-mouse’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Allow mouse usage during the Helm session when non-nil.

     Note that this also allows moving out of minibuffer when clicking
     outside of ‘helm-buffer’, so it is up to you to get back to Helm by
     clicking back in ‘helm-buffer’ or minibuffer.

Source
......

‘helm-source-names-using-follow’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of source names to have follow enabled.  This list of source
     names will be used only when ‘helm-follow-mode-persistent’ is
     non-nil.

     You don’t have to customize this yourself unless you really want
     and know what you are doing, instead just set
     ‘helm-follow-mode-persistent’ to non-nil and as soon as you turn on
     or off ‘helm-follow-mode’ (C-c C-f) in a source, Helm will save or
     remove source name in this variable.

Search
......

‘helm-case-fold-search’

     *Standard Value*: smart

     Adds ’smart’ option to ‘case-fold-search’.  Smart option ignores
     case for searches as long as there are no upper case characters in
     the pattern.

     Use nil or t to turn off smart behavior and use ‘case-fold-search’
     behavior.

     Default is smart.

     NOTE: Case fold search has no effect when searching asynchronous
     sources, which relies on customized features implemented directly
     into their execution process.  See helm-grep.el for an example.

‘helm-file-name-case-fold-search’

     *Standard Value*: smart

     Local setting of ‘helm-case-fold-search’ for reading filenames.

     See ‘helm-case-fold-search’ for more info.

Action
......

‘helm-action-at-nth-negative-prefix-key’

     *Standard Value*: C-x %d

     The prefix key to execute default action on nth <-n> candidate.

     This is a format spec where %d will be replaced by the candidate
     number.

     NOTE: ‘setq’ have no effect until you restart Emacs, use customize
     for immediate effect.

‘helm-action-at-nth-positive-prefix-key’

     *Standard Value*: C-c %d

     The prefix key to execute default action on nth <+n> candidate.

     This is a format spec where %d will be replaced by the candidate
     number.

     sources.

‘helm-fuzzy-sort-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-fuzzy-matching-default-sort-fn

Autoresize
..........

‘helm-autoresize-max-height’

     *Standard Value*: 40

     frame height.

     See ‘fit-window-to-buffer’ for more infos.

‘helm-autoresize-min-height’

     *Standard Value*: 10

     Specify minimum height and defaults to percent of Helm window’s
     frame height.

     If nil, ‘window-min-height’ is used.  See ‘fit-window-to-buffer’
     for details.

Line
....

‘helm-header-line-space-before-prompt’

     *Standard Value*: left-fringe

     Specify the space before prompt in header-line.

     This will be used when ‘helm-echo-input-in-header-line’ is non-nil.

     Value can be one of the symbols ’left-fringe or ’left-margin or an
     integer specifying the number of spaces before prompt.  Note that
     on input longer that ‘window-width’ the continuation string will be
     shown on left side of window without taking care of this.

‘helm-input-method-verbose-flag’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     The default value for ‘input-method-verbose-flag’ used in Helm
     minibuffer.  It is nil by default, which does not turn off input
     method.  Helm updates and exits without interruption – necessary
     for complex methods.

     If set to any other value as per ‘input-method-verbose-flag’, then
     use ‘C-\’ to disable the ‘current-input-method’ to exit or update
     Helm.

Mode
....

‘helm--minor-mode-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook run after entering or leaving ‘helm--minor-mode’.  No problems
     result if this variable is not bound.  ‘add-hook’ automatically
     binds it.  (This is true for all hook variables.)

‘helm--remap-mouse-mode-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     *Standard Value*: nil

     When non-nil, save last state of ‘helm-follow-mode’ for the next
     Emacs sessions.

     Each time you turn on or off ‘helm-follow-mode’, the current source
     name will be stored or removed from
     ‘helm-source-names-using-follow’.

     Note that this may be disabled in some places where it is unsafe to
     use because persistent action is changing according to context.

Default
.......

‘helm-sources-using-default-as-input’

     *Standard Value*:

          (helm-source-imenu helm-source-imenu-all helm-source-info-elisp helm-source-etags-select helm-source-man-pages helm-source-occur helm-source-moccur helm-source-grep-ag helm-source-grep-git helm-source-grep)

     handle this.

‘helm-split-window-in-side-p’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Force split inside selected window when non-nil.  See also
     ‘helm-split-window-default-side’.

     handle this.

‘helm-split-window-inside-p’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Force split inside selected window when non-nil.  See also
     ‘helm-split-window-default-side’.

     frame only has one window.  Possible values are acceptable args for
     ‘split-window’ SIDE, that is ‘below’, ‘above’, ‘left’ or ‘right’.

     If ‘helm-full-frame’ is non-nil, it takes precedence over this
     setting.

     See also ‘helm-split-window-inside-p’ and ‘helm-always-two-windows’
     that takes precedence over this.

     NOTE: this has no effect if ‘helm-split-window-preferred-function’

     is true for all hook variables.)

Display Function
................

‘helm-display-function’

     *Standard Value*: helm-default-display-buffer

     Function used to display ‘helm-buffer’.

     Local value in ‘helm-buffer’ will take precedence on this default
     value.  Commands that are in ‘helm-commands-using-frame’ will have
     ‘helm-buffer’ displayed in frame, ‘helm-display-function’ being
     ignored.  If no local value is found and current command is not one
     of ‘helm-commands-using-frame’ use this default value.  The
     function in charge of deciding which value use is
     ‘helm-resolve-display-function’.

     To set it locally to ‘helm-buffer’ in Helm sources use

     “(elisp) Action Alists for Buffer Display”).

     It has no effect when ‘helm-always-two-windows’ is non-nil and may
     override other settings like ‘helm-split-window-inside-p’.  Note
     that window-height and window-width have to be configured in
     ‘helm-display-buffer-height’ and ‘helm-display-buffer-width’.

‘helm-default-display-buffer-functions’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Action functions to pass to ‘display-buffer’.  See (info “(elisp)
     Action Functions for Buffer Display”).

     It has no effect when ‘helm-always-two-windows’ is non-nil and may
     override other settings like ‘helm-split-window-inside-p’.

‘helm-display-buffer-default-height’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Initial height of ‘helm-buffer’, specified as an integer or a
     function.

     The function should take one arg and be responsible for re-sizing

     for more info.

Display Buffer uncategorized
............................

‘helm-display-buffer-reuse-frame’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     When non nil Helm frame is not deleted and reused in next sessions.

     This was used to workaround a bug in Emacs where frames where
     popping up slowly, now that the bug have been fixed upstream
     (emacs-27) probably you don’t want to use this any more.  On
     emacs-26 set ‘x-wait-for-event-timeout’ to nil to have your frames
     popping up fast.

Display uncategorized
.....................

‘helm-display-source-at-screen-top’

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm--Remap-Mouse mode’.  If the
     prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

     WARNING: Do not use this mode yourself, it is internal to Helm.

‘helm-autoresize-mode’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     (helm-autoresize-mode &optional ARG)

     Auto resize helm window when enabled.  Helm window is re-sized
     according to ‘helm-autoresize-max-height’ and
     ‘helm-autoresize-min-height’.  Note that when this mode is enabled,
     Helm behaves as if ‘helm-always-two-windows’ is enabled.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm-Autoresize mode’.  If the
     prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable

     doesn’t enable debugging by itself.

     See ‘helm-log-save-maybe’ for more info.

‘helm-samewindow’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use current window for showing candidates.  If t, then Helm does
     not pop-up a new window.

1.1.5 Hooks in library ‘helm’
-----------------------------

Run
...

‘helm-log-run-hook’

     *Standard Value*:

Exit
....

‘helm-confirm-and-exit-hook’

     *Standard Value*:

Temp
....

‘with-helm-temp-hook’

     *Standard Value*:

Hooks
.....

‘helm--run-init-hooks’

     *Standard Value*:

‘helm--temp-hooks’

     *Standard Value*:

          ((helm--hook94 . helm-after-update-hook))

     Store temporary hooks added by ‘with-helm-temp-hook’.

Minibuffer
..........

‘helm-exit-minibuffer-hook’

     *Standard Value*:

          (helm-files-save-file-name-history)

     Runs just before exiting the minibuffer.

     This hook runs when Helm exits the minibuffer normally (e.g., via
     candidate selection), but does NOT run if Helm exits the minibuffer
     abnormally (e.g.  via ‘helm-keyboard-quit’).

‘helm-minibuffer-set-up-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook that runs at minibuffer initialization.  A hook useful for
     modifying minibuffer settings in Helm.

     An example that hides the minibuffer when using
     ‘helm-echo-input-in-header-line’:

     (add-hook ’helm-minibuffer-set-up-hook
     #’helm-hide-minibuffer-maybe)

     Note that we check ‘helm-echo-input-in-header-line’ value from
     ‘helm-buffer’ which allows detecting possible local value of this
     var.

Autoresize
..........

‘helm--autoresize-hook’

     *Standard Value*:

Before
......

‘helm-before-initialize-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Runs before Helm initialization.  This hook runs before init
     functions in ‘helm-sources’, which is before creation of
     ‘helm-buffer’.  Set local variables for ‘helm-buffer’ that need a
     value from ‘current-buffer’ with ‘helm-set-local-variable’.

Buffer List
...........

‘helm-boring-buffer-regexp-list’

     *Standard Value*:

          ("\\` " "\\`\\*helm" "\\`\\*Echo Area" "\\`\\*Minibuf")

     The regexp list that match boring buffers.  Buffer candidates
     matching these regular expression will be filtered from the list of
     candidates if the ‘helm-skip-boring-buffers’ candidate transformer
     is used.

‘helm-buffer-list-reorder-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-buffers-reorder-buffer-list

     A function in charge of ordering the initial buffer list.  It takes
     two arguments VISIBLES buffers and OTHERS buffers.  Arg VISIBLES
     handles the buffers visibles in this frame.  Arg OTHERS handles all
     the other buffers.  You can write a function that reorder VISIBLES
     and OTHERS as you want.  Default function returns OTHERS buffers on
     top and VISIBLES buffer at the end.  See
     ‘helm-buffers-reorder-buffer-list’.

‘helm-white-buffer-regexp-list’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     The regexp list of not boring buffers.  These buffers will be
     displayed even if they match one of

          ((dired-mode . "Dired")
           (lisp-interaction-mode . "Lisp Inter"))

     An alist specifying pretty names for modes.  Most of the time
     buffer’s ‘mode-name’ is a string so no need to add it here as there
     is no need to compute it, but sometimes it may be a mode-line
     specification which may be costly to compute, in this case add here
     the pretty name as a string to avoid this costly computation.  Also
     if some pretty names are too long you can add your own abbreviation
     here.

‘helm-buffer-details-flag’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Always show details in buffer list when non-nil.

‘helm-buffer-max-length’

     *Standard Value*: 20

     Fuzzy matching buffer names when non-nil.  Only buffer names are
     fuzzy matched when this is enabled, ‘major-mode’ matching is not
     affected by this.

‘helm-buffers-left-margin-width’

     *Standard Value*: 0

     ‘left-margin-width’ value for ‘helm-mini’ and ‘helm-buffers-list’.

‘helm-buffers-maybe-switch-to-tab’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Switch to buffer in its tab when non nil.  This has no effect when
     ‘tab-bar-mode’ is not available.

‘helm-buffers-sort-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-fuzzy-matching-default-sort-fn

     The sort function to use in ‘helm-buffers-list’.

     Default to ‘helm-fuzzy-sort-fn’ you can use
     ‘helm-fuzzy-matching-sort-fn-preserve-ties-order’ as alternative if
     you want to keep the recentest order when narrowing candidates.

‘helm-buffers-truncate-lines’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Truncate lines in ‘helm-buffers-list’ when non-nil.

     ‘helm-M-x’ save command in ‘extended-command-history’ even when it
     fails.

‘helm-M-x-reverse-history’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     The history source of ‘helm-M-x’ appear in second position when
     non-nil.

‘helm-M-x-use-completion-styles’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use ‘completion-styles’ and dynamic completion when non nil.  It is
     disable by default as it is a regression starting from Emacs-27.

minor-mode-p
............

‘helm-mode’

     *Standard Value*: t

     (helm-mode &optional ARG)

     Toggle generic helm completion.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm mode’.  If the prefix
     argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

     All functions in Emacs that use ‘completing-read’,
     ‘read-file-name’, ‘completion-in-region’ and friends will use helm
     interface when this mode is turned on.

     However you can modify this behavior for functions of your choice
     with ‘helm-completing-read-handlers-alist’.

     Called with a positive arg, turn on unconditionally, with a
     negative arg turn off.  You can toggle it with M-x ‘helm-mode’.

     About ‘ido-mode’: DO NOT enable ‘ido-everywhere’ when using
     ‘helm-mode’.  Instead of using ‘ido-mode’, add the commands where
     you want to use ido to ‘helm-completing-read-handlers-alist’ with
     ‘ido’ as value.

     Note: This mode is incompatible with Emacs23.

Search
......

‘helm-dabbrev-always-search-all’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Always search in all buffers when non–nil.  Note that even if nil,
     a search in all buffers will occur if the length of candidates is
     <= than ‘helm-dabbrev-max-length-result’.

‘helm-dabbrev-case-fold-search’

     *Standard Value*: smart

     Set ‘case-fold-search’ in ‘helm-dabbrev’.  Same as
     ‘helm-case-fold-search’ but for ‘helm-dabbrev’.  Note that this is
     not affecting searching in Helm buffer, but the initial search for
     all candidates in buffer(s).

uncategorized
.............

‘helm-dabbrev-candidates-number-limit’

     *Standard Value*: 1000

     Maximum number of candidates to collect.

     The higher this number is, the slower the computation of candidates
     will be.  You can use safely a higher value with emacs-26+.  Note
     that this have nothing to do with ‘helm-candidate-number-limit’,
     this means that computation of candidates stop when this value is
     reached but only ‘helm-candidate-number-limit’ candidates are
     displayed in the Helm buffer.

‘helm-dabbrev-cycle-threshold’

     *Standard Value*: 5

     Number of time helm-dabbrev cycle before displaying helm
     completion.  When nil or 0 disable cycling.

‘helm-dabbrev-ignored-buffers-regexps’

     *Standard Value*:

          ("\\*helm" "\\*Messages" "\\*Echo Area" "\\*Buffer List")

     List of regexps matching names of buffers that ‘helm-dabbrev’
     should not check.

‘helm-dabbrev-lineno-around’

     *Standard Value*: 30

     Search first in this number of lines before and after point.

‘helm-dabbrev-major-mode-assoc’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Major mode association alist.

     This allow helm-dabbrev searching in buffers with the associated
     ‘major-mode’.  E.g.  (emacs-lisp-mode .  lisp-interaction-mode)

     will allow searching in the lisp-interaction-mode buffer when
     ‘current-buffer’ is an ‘emacs-lisp-mode’ buffer and vice versa i.e.
     no need to provide (lisp-interaction-mode .  emacs-lisp-mode)
     association.

     When nil check is the searched buffer has same ‘major-mode’ than
     the ‘current-buffer’.

     This has no effect when ‘helm-dabbrev-related-buffer-fn’ is nil or
     of course bound to a function that doesn’t handle this var.

‘helm-dabbrev-related-buffer-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-dabbrev–same-major-mode-p

     A function that decide if a buffer to search in its related to
     ‘current-buffer’.

     This is actually determined by comparing ‘major-mode’ of the buffer
     to search and the ‘current-buffer’.

     The function take one arg, the buffer which is current, look at
     ‘helm-dabbrev--same-major-mode-p’ for an example.

     When nil all buffers are considered related to ‘current-buffer’.

----------------------------------------------------

uncategorized Helm
..................

‘C-<tab>’

‘C-x c <tab>’ (‘helm-lisp-completion-at-point’)

     Preconfigured Helm for Lisp symbol completion at point.

uncategorized Char
..................

‘<left>’

‘C-b’ (‘backward-char’)

     (backward-char &optional N)

     Move point N characters backward (forward if N is negative).  On
     attempt to pass beginning or end of buffer, stop and signal error.
     Interactively, N is the numeric prefix argument.  If N is omitted
     or nil, move point 1 character backward.

     Depending on the bidirectional context, the movement may be to the
     right or to the left on the screen.  This is in contrast with
     \[left-char], which see.

‘<right>’

‘C-f’ (‘forward-char’)

     (forward-char &optional N)

     Move point N characters forward (backward if N is negative).  On
     reaching end or beginning of buffer, stop and signal error.
     Interactively, N is the numeric prefix argument.  If N is omitted
     or nil, move point 1 character forward.

     Depending on the bidirectional context, the movement may be to the
     right or to the left on the screen.  This is in contrast with
     \[right-char], which see.

uncategorized Line
..................

‘C-<return>’ (‘helm-eval-new-line-and-indent’)

‘M-<tab>’ (‘lisp-indent-line’)

     (lisp-indent-line &optional INDENT)

     Indent current line as Lisp code.

‘<down>’

‘C-n’ (‘next-line’)

     (next-line &optional ARG TRY-VSCROLL)

     Move cursor vertically down ARG lines.  Interactively, vscroll tall
     lines if ‘auto-window-vscroll’ is enabled.  Non-interactively, use
     TRY-VSCROLL to control whether to vscroll tall lines: if either
     ‘auto-window-vscroll’ or TRY-VSCROLL is nil, this function will not
     vscroll.

     ARG defaults to 1.

     If there is no character in the target line exactly under the
     current column, the cursor is positioned after the character in
     that line that spans this column, or at the end of the line if it
     is not long enough.  If there is no line in the buffer after this
     one, behavior depends on the value of ‘next-line-add-newlines’.  If
     non-nil, it inserts a newline character to create a line, and moves
     the cursor to that line.  Otherwise it moves the cursor to the end
     of the buffer.

     If the variable ‘line-move-visual’ is non-nil, this command moves
     by display lines.  Otherwise, it moves by buffer lines, without
     taking variable-width characters or continued lines into account.
     See \[next-logical-line] for a command that always moves by buffer
     lines.

     The command \[set-goal-column] can be used to create a
     semipermanent goal column for this command.  Then instead of trying
     to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible), this command
     moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).  The
     goal column is stored in the variable ‘goal-column’, which is nil
     when there is no goal column.  Note that setting ‘goal-column’
     overrides ‘line-move-visual’ and causes this command to move by
     buffer lines rather than by display lines.

‘<up>’

‘C-p’ (‘previous-line’)

     (previous-line &optional ARG TRY-VSCROLL)

     Move cursor vertically up ARG lines.  Interactively, vscroll tall
     lines if ‘auto-window-vscroll’ is enabled.  Non-interactively, use
     TRY-VSCROLL to control whether to vscroll tall lines: if either
     ‘auto-window-vscroll’ or TRY-VSCROLL is nil, this function will not
     vscroll.

     ARG defaults to 1.

     If there is no character in the target line exactly over the
     current column, the cursor is positioned after the character in
     that line that spans this column, or at the end of the line if it
     is not long enough.

     If the variable ‘line-move-visual’ is non-nil, this command moves
     by display lines.  Otherwise, it moves by buffer lines, without
     taking variable-width characters or continued lines into account.
     See \[previous-logical-line] for a command that always moves by
     buffer lines.

     The command \[set-goal-column] can be used to create a
     semipermanent goal column for this command.  Then instead of trying
     to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible), this command
     moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).  The
     goal column is stored in the variable ‘goal-column’, which is nil
     when there is no goal column.  Note that setting ‘goal-column’
     overrides ‘line-move-visual’ and causes this command to move by
     buffer lines rather than by display lines.

        • candidate basename is “.” => open the action menu.
        • candidate is a directory => expand it.
        • candidate is a file => open action menu.

     Called with a prefix arg open menu unconditionally.

‘helm-ff-delete-char-backward’

     Go up one level or disable HFF auto update and delete char
     backward.

     Going up one level works only when pattern is a directory endings
     with “/”, otherwise this command deletes char backward.

     Going up one level can be disabled if necessary by deleting “/” at
     end of pattern using \<helm-map>\[backward-char] and
     \[helm-delete-minibuffer-contents].

‘helm-ff-kill-rsync-process’

     (helm-ff-kill-rsync-process PROCESS)

     Kill rsync process PROCESS.

     When called interactively prompt user with completion when more
     than one process.

minor-mode-p
............

‘helm-ff--delete-async-modeline-mode’

     (helm-ff–delete-async-modeline-mode &optional ARG)

     Notify mode-line that an async process run.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm-Ff–Delete-Async-Modeline
     mode’.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if
     it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

‘helm-browse-project’

     (helm-browse-project ARG)

     Preconfigured helm to browse projects.  Browse files and see status
     of project with its VCS.  Only HG and GIT are supported for now.
     Fall back to ‘helm-browse-project-find-files’ if current directory
     is not under control of one of those VCS.  With a prefix ARG browse
     files recursively, with two prefix ARG rebuild the cache.  If the
     current directory is found in the cache, start
     ‘helm-browse-project-find-files’ even with no prefix ARG.  NOTE:
     The prefix ARG have no effect on the VCS controlled directories.

     Needed dependencies for VCS:
     <https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-ls-git> and
     <https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-ls-hg>.

‘C-x c C-x C-f’

‘<open>’

‘C-x C-f’ (‘helm-find-files’)

     (helm-find-files ARG)

     Preconfigured ‘helm’ for helm implementation of ‘find-file’.
     Called with a prefix arg show history if some.  Don’t call it from
     programs, use ‘helm-find-files-1’ instead.  This is the starting
     point for nearly all actions you can do on files.

‘helm-projects-history’

     (helm-projects-history ARG)

1.18.7 Options in library ‘helm-files’
--------------------------------------

On
..

‘helm-substitute-in-filename-stay-on-remote’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Don’t switch back to local filesystem when expanding pattern with /
     or ~/.

List
....

‘helm-list-directory-function’

     *Standard Value*: helm-list-dir-external

     The function used in ‘helm-find-files’ to list remote directories.

     Actually Helm provides two functions to do this:
     ‘helm-list-dir-lisp’ and ‘helm-list-dir-external’.

     Using ‘helm-list-dir-external’ will provide a similar display to
     what is provided with local files i.e.  colorized symlinks,
     executables files etc., whereas using ‘helm-list-dir-lisp’ will
     allow colorizing only directories but it is more portable.

     NOTE: ‘helm-list-dir-external’ needs ls and awk as dependencies.
     Also the ls version installed on the remote side should support the
     same arguments as the GNU/ls version, which are -A -1 -F -b and -Q.
     So even if you are using a GNU/ls version locally and you want to
     connect e.g.  on a Freebsd server, you may have failures due to the
     incompatible ls version installed on remote server.  In such case
     use ‘helm-list-dir-lisp’ which works everywhere but is slower and
     less featured (only directories colorized).

Rsync
.....

‘helm-rsync-percent-sign’

     *Standard Value*: ％

     Percentage unicode sign to use in Rsync reporter.

‘helm-rsync-switches’

     *Standard Value*:

          ("-a" "-z" "-h" "-s" "--info=all2")

     Rsync options to use with HFF Rsync action.  Note: Using
     “–info=all2” allows having the name of the file currently
     transfered in an help-echo in mode-line, if you use
     “–info=progress2” you will not have this information.

Mode
....

‘helm-rsync-no-mode-line-update’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     When non nil don’t update mode-line when rsync is running.  This is
     useful if you display the progress bar somewhere else, e.g.  with
     minibuffer-line in minibuffer, in this case updating mode-line may
     create flickering in other frame’s mode-line.

Files Find
..........

‘helm-browse-project-default-find-files-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-browse-project-fd-find-files

     The default function to retrieve files in a non-vc directory.

     A function that takes a directory name as only arg.

‘helm-find-files-actions’

           ("Locate ~C-x C-f, C-u to specify locate db~" . helm-ff-locate))

     Actions for ‘helm-find-files’.

‘helm-find-files-after-init-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook that run after initialization of ‘helm-find-files’.

‘helm-find-files-before-init-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook that run before initialization of ‘helm-find-files’.

‘helm-find-files-bookmark-prefix’

     *Standard Value*: Helm-find-files:

     bookmark name prefix of ‘helm-find-files’ sessions.

‘helm-find-files-ignore-thing-at-point’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use only ‘default-directory’ as default input in ‘helm-find-files’.
     I.e.  text under cursor in ‘current-buffer’ is ignored.  Note that
     when non-nil you will be unable to complete filename at point in
     ‘current-buffer’.

Files uncategorized
...................

‘helm-files-save-history-extra-sources’

     *Standard Value*:

          ("Find" "Locate" "Recentf" "Files from Current Directory" "File Cache")

     Extras source that save candidate to ‘file-name-history’.

‘helm-trash-remote-files’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Allow trashing remote files when non-nil.

     Trashing remote files with tramp doesn’t work out of the box unless
     the ’trash-cli’ package is installed.  This is why trashing remote
     files from Helm is disabled by default.

     Tramp is using external ’trash’ command in its ‘delete-file’ and
     ‘delete-directory’ handlers when using ‘delete-by-moving-to-trash’,
     which is documented nowhere in Emacs.

     If you want to enable this you will have to install the ’trash’
     command on remote (and/or locally if you want to trash as root).
     On Ubuntu-based distributions it is ’trash-cli’.

Ff Mode
.......

‘helm-ff-preferred-shell-mode’

     *Standard Value*: eshell-mode

     Shell to use to switch to a shell buffer from ‘helm-find-files’.
     Possible values are ‘shell-mode’, ‘eshell-mode’ and ‘term-mode’.
     This affects ‘M-e’ keybinding.

Ff List
.......

‘helm-ff-printer-list’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of available printers on your system.  When non-nil let you
     choose a printer to print file.  Otherwise when nil the variable
     ‘printer-name’ will be used.  On Unix based systems (lpstat command
     needed) you don’t need to set this, ‘helm-ff-find-printers’ will
     find a list of available printers for you.

Ff Allow
........

‘helm-ff-allow-recursive-deletes’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     When ’always don’t prompt for recursive deletion of directories.
     When nil, will ask for recursive deletion.  Note that when deleting
     multiple directories you can answer !  when prompted to avoid being
     asked for next directories, so it is probably better to not modify
     this variable.

Ff Guess
........

‘helm-ff-guess-ffap-filenames’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use ffap to guess local filenames at point in ‘helm-find-files’.
     This doesn’t disable url or mail at point, see
     ‘helm-ff-guess-ffap-urls’ for this.

‘helm-ff-guess-ffap-urls’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Use ffap to guess local urls at point in ‘helm-find-files’.  This
     doesn’t disable guessing filenames at point, see
     ‘helm-ff-guess-ffap-filenames’ for this.  See also
     ‘ffap-url-unwrap-remote’ that may override this variable.

Ff Level
........

‘helm-ff-DEL-up-one-level-maybe’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use DEL to maybe go up one level when non nil.

     Going up one level works only when pattern is a directory endings
     with “/”, otherwise this command deletes char backward.

     When nil always delete char backward.

Ff Delete
.........

‘helm-ff--delete-async-modeline-mode-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook run after entering or leaving
     ‘helm-ff--delete-async-modeline-mode’.  No problems result if this
     variable is not bound.  ‘add-hook’ automatically binds it.  (This
     is true for all hook variables.)

Ff Update
.........

‘helm-ff-reset-filters-on-update’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Reset filter variables when changing directory.  When filtering
     directories/files only, switch back to a “show all” view when
     moving out of directory when non nil.

Ff History
..........

‘helm-ff-history-max-length’

     *Standard Value*: 100

     Number of elements shown in ‘helm-find-files’ history.

Ff Initial
..........

‘helm-ff-auto-update-initial-value’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Auto update when only one candidate directory is matched.  Default
     value when starting ‘helm-find-files’ is nil to not confuse new
     users.  For a better experience with ‘helm-find-files’ set this to
     non-nil and use C-<backspace> to toggle it.

‘helm-ff-initial-sort-method’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Sort method to use when initially listing a directory.  Note that
     this doesn’t affect the listing when matching inside the directory
     (i.e.  filenames).

Ff Preselect
............

‘helm-ff-no-preselect’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     When non-nil ‘helm-find-files’ starts at root of current directory.

‘helm-ff-up-one-level-preselect’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Always preselect previous directory when going one level up.

     When non-nil ‘candidate-number-limit’ source value is modified
     dynamically when going one level up if the position of previous
     candidate in its directory is > to
     ‘helm-ff-candidate-number-limit’.

     It can be helpful to disable this and reduce
     ‘helm-ff-candidate-number-limit’ if you often navigate across very
     large directories.

Ff File
.......

‘helm-ff-allow-non-existing-file-at-point’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use non existing file-at-point as initial input in
     ‘helm-find-files’.

‘helm-ff-file-compressed-list’

     *Standard Value*:

          ("gz" "bz2" "zip" "7z")

     Minimal list of compressed files extension.

‘helm-ff-file-name-history-use-recentf’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use ‘recentf-list’ instead of ‘file-name-history’ in
     ‘helm-find-files’.

Ff Image
........

‘helm-ff-display-image-native’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Use native ‘image-mode’ when non nil.

     You should use this only with Emacs>= 27 and ‘image-auto-resize’
     enabled to have images resized properly.  When this is enabled, you
     have new commands to zoom in/out images.  See
     ‘image-transform-resize’ and ‘image-auto-resize’.  Otherwise, when
     nil ‘image-dired’ is used, using imagemagick as backend.  NOTE: If
     you see image-mode is eating too much memory, you better have to
     set this to nil (default).

‘helm-ff-rotate-image-switch’

     *Standard Value*:

          ("-i")

     Options used with ‘helm-ff-rotate-image-program’.  If you are using
     Mogrify or Jpegtran mandatory option is “-rotate”, with Exiftran
     mandatory option is “-i”.

Ff Program
..........

‘helm-ff-exif-data-program’

     *Standard Value*: exiftran

     Program used to extract exif data of an image file.

‘helm-ff-exif-data-program-args’

     *Standard Value*: -d

     Arguments used for ‘helm-ff-exif-data-program’.

‘helm-ff-rotate-image-program’

     *Standard Value*: exiftran

     External program used to rotate images.  When nil and
     ‘helm-ff-display-image-native’ is enabled, fallback to
     ‘image-rotate’ without modification of exif data i.e.  rotation is
     not persistent otherwise an error is returned when not using
     ‘helm-ff-display-image-native’ i.e.  using image-dired.

Ff Files
........

‘helm-ff-delete-files-function’

     *Standard Value*: helm-delete-marked-files

     The function to use by default to delete files.

     Default is to delete files synchronously, other choice is to delete
     files asynchronously.

     BE AWARE that when deleting async you will not be warned about
     recursive deletion of directories, IOW non-empty directories will
     be deleted with no warnings in background!!!

     It is the function that will be used when using ‘M-D’ from
     ‘helm-find-files’.

‘helm-ff-signal-error-on-dot-files’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Signal error when file is ‘.’ or ‘..’ on file deletion when
     non-nil.  Default is non-nil.  WARNING: Setting this to nil is
     unsafe and can cause deletion of a whole tree.

‘helm-ff-skip-boring-files’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Non-nil to skip boring files.  I.e.  the files matching regexps in
     ‘helm-boring-file-regexp-list’.  This takes effect in
     ‘helm-find-files’ and file completion used by ‘helm-mode’ i.e.
     ‘helm-read-file-name’.  Note that when non-nil this will slow down
     slightly ‘helm-find-files’.

‘helm-ff-skip-git-ignored-files’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Non-nil to skip git ignored files.  This take effect only in
     ‘helm-find-files’.  Check is not done on remote files.  Note that
     when non-nil this will slow down slightly ‘helm-find-files’.

Ff uncategorized uncategorized uncategorized
............................................

‘helm-ff-avfs-directory’

     *Standard Value*: ~/.avfs

     The default avfs directory, usually ’~/.avfs’.  When this is set
     you will be able to expand archive filenames with ‘C-j’ inside an
     avfs directory mounted with mountavfs.  See
     <http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf/>.

‘helm-ff-candidate-number-limit’

     *Standard Value*: 5000

     The ‘helm-candidate-number-limit’ for ‘helm-find-files’ and
     friends.  Note that when going one level up with ‘C-l’ the length
     of directory will be used instead if it is higher than this value.
     This is to avoid failing to preselect the previous directory/file
     if this one is situated lower than ‘helm-ff-candidate-number-limit’
     num candidate.

‘helm-ff-fuzzy-matching’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Enable fuzzy matching for ‘helm-find-files’ when non–nil.  See
     ‘helm-ff--transform-pattern-for-completion’ for more info.

‘helm-ff-goto-first-real-dired-exceptions’

     *Standard Value*:

          (dired-goto-file)

     Dired commands that are allowed moving to first real candidate.

‘helm-ff-kill-or-find-buffer-fname-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-ff-kill-or-find-buffer-fname

     Default function used to expand non-directory filenames in
     ‘helm-find-files’.

     This variable will take effect only in ‘helm-find-files’.  It
     affects the behavior of persistent-action on filenames and
     non-existing filenames.

     The default is to expand filename on first hit on C-j, pop buffer
     in other window on second hit and finally kill this buffer on third
     hit.  This is very handy to create several new buffers, or when
     navigating, show quickly the buffer of file to see its contents
     briefly before killing it and continue navigating.

     However some users may not want this, so to disable this behaviour
     just set this to ‘ignore’ function.

     Of course you can also write your own function to do something
     else.

‘helm-ff-lynx-style-map’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Use arrow keys to navigate with ‘helm-find-files’.  Note that if
     you define this variable with ‘setq’ your change will have no
     effect, use customize instead.

‘helm-ff-newfile-prompt-p’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Whether Prompt or not when creating new file.  This set
     ‘ffap-newfile-prompt’.

‘helm-ff-search-library-in-sexp’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Search for library in ‘require’ and ‘declare-function’ sexp.

‘helm-ff-transformer-show-only-basename’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Show only basename of candidates in ‘helm-find-files’.  This can be
     toggled at anytime from ‘helm-find-files’ with C-].

minor-mode-p
............

‘helm-ff--delete-async-modeline-mode’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     (helm-ff–delete-async-modeline-mode &optional ARG)

     Notify mode-line that an async process run.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm-Ff–Delete-Async-Modeline
     mode’.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if
     it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

uncategorized
.............

‘helm-dwim-target’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Default target directory for file actions.

     Define the directory where you want to start navigating for the
     target directory when copying, renaming, etc..  You can use the
     ‘default-directory’ of ‘next-window’, the current
     ‘default-directory’ or have completion on all the directories
     belonging to each window.

‘helm-modes-using-escaped-strings’

     *Standard Value*:

          (eshell-mode shell-mode term-mode)

     Modes that requires string’s insertion to be escaped.

‘helm-mounted-network-directories’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of directories used for mounting remotes filesystem.

     When nil ‘helm-file-on-mounted-network-p’ always return nil
     otherwise check if a file is in one of these directories.

     Remote filesystem are generally mounted with sshfs.

‘helm-tooltip-hide-delay’

     *Standard Value*: 25

     Hide tooltips automatically after this many seconds.

‘helm-tramp-verbose’

     *Standard Value*: 0

     Just like ‘tramp-verbose’ but specific to Helm.  When set to 0
     don’t show tramp messages in Helm.  If you want to have the default

‘C-x c C-c f’ (‘helm-recentf’)

     Preconfigured ‘helm’ for ‘recentf’.

Run Find
........

‘/’

‘C-x c /’ (‘helm-find’)

     (helm-find ARG)

     Preconfigured ‘helm’ for the find shell command.

     Recursively find files whose names are matched by all specified
     globbing PATTERNs under the current directory using the external
     program specified in ‘find-program’ (usually “find”).  Every input
     PATTERN is silently wrapped into two stars: *PATTERN*.

     With prefix argument, prompt for a directory to search.

     When user option ‘helm-findutils-search-full-path’ is non-nil,
     match against complete paths, otherwise, against file names without
     directory part.

     The (possibly empty) list of globbing PATTERNs can be followed by

     two prefix arg, refresh the current local db or create it if it
     doesn’t exists.

     To create a user specific db, use “updatedb -l 0 -o db_path -U
     directory”.  Where db_path is a filename matched by
     ‘helm-locate-db-file-regexp’.

List Buffers
............

Run Occur
.........

‘M-s o’

‘C-x c M-s o’ (‘helm-occur’)

     ‘current-buffer’.

     When ‘helm-source-occur’ is member of
     ‘helm-sources-using-default-as-input’ which is the default, symbol
     at point is searched at startup.

     When a region is marked search only in this region by narrowing.

     To search in multiples buffers start from one of the commands
     listing buffers (i.e.  a helm command using
     ‘helm-source-buffers-list’ like ‘helm-mini’) and use the multi
     occur buffers action.

     This is the helm implementation that collect lines matching pattern
     like vanilla Emacs ‘occur’ but have nothing to do with it, the
     search engine beeing completely different and also much faster.

1.23.6 Options in library ‘helm-grep’
-------------------------------------

Style
.....

‘helm-grep-file-path-style’

     *Standard Value*: basename

     File path display style when grep results are displayed.  Possible
     value are: basename: displays only the filename, none of the
     directory path absolute: displays absolute path relative: displays
     relative path from root grep directory.

‘helm-grep-use-ioccur-style-keys’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Use Arrow keys to jump to occurences.  Note that if you define this
     variable with ‘setq’ your change will have no effect, use customize
     instead.

Zgrep
.....

‘helm-zgrep-file-extension-regexp’

     *Standard Value*: .*$

     Default file extensions zgrep will search in.

Ignored
.......

‘helm-grep-ignored-directories’

     *Standard Value*:

          ("SCCS/" "RCS/" "CVS/" "MCVS/" ".svn/" ".git/" ".hg/" ".bzr/" "_MTN/" "_darcs/" "{arch}/" ".gvfs/")

     List of names of sub-directories which ‘helm-grep’ shall not
     recurse into.

‘helm-grep-ignored-files’

     *Standard Value*:

          (".#*" "*.o" "*~" "*.bin" "*.lbin" "*.so" "*.a" "*.ln" "*.blg" "*.bbl" "*.elc" "*.lof" "*.glo" "*.idx" "*.lot" "*.fmt" "*.tfm" "*.class" "*.fas" "*.lib" "*.mem" "*.x86f" "*.sparcf" "*.dfsl" "*.pfsl" "*.d64fsl" "*.p64fsl" "*.lx64fsl" "*.lx32fsl" "*.dx64fsl" "*.dx32fsl" "*.fx64fsl" "*.fx32fsl" "*.sx64fsl" "*.sx32fsl" "*.wx64fsl" "*.wx32fsl" "*.fasl" "*.ufsl" "*.fsl" "*.dxl" "*.lo" "*.la" "*.gmo" "*.mo" "*.toc" "*.aux" "*.cp" "*.fn" "*.ky" "*.pg" "*.tp" "*.vr" "*.cps" "*.fns" "*.kys" "*.pgs" "*.tps" "*.vrs" "*.pyc" "*.pyo")

     List of file names which ‘helm-grep’ shall exclude.

Switches
........

‘helm-grep-ag-pipe-cmd-switches’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of additional parameters to pass to grep-ag pipe command.
     Use parameters compatibles with the backend you are using (i.e.  AG
     for AG, PT for PT or RG for RG)

     You probably don’t need to use this unless you know what you are
     doing.

‘helm-grep-pipe-cmd-switches’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of additional parameters to pass to grep pipe command.  This
     will be used to pipe command for multiple pattern matching for
     grep, zgrep ack-grep and git-grep backends.  If you add extra args
     for ack-grep, use ack-grep options, for others (grep, zgrep and
     git-grep) use grep options.  Here are the commands where you may
     want to add switches:

     grep –color=always ack-grep –smart-case –color

     You probably don’t need to use this unless you know what you are
     doing.

Command Default
...............

‘helm-default-zgrep-command’

     *Standard Value*: zgrep –color=always -a -n%cH -e %p %f

     Default command for Zgrep.  See ‘helm-grep-default-command’ for
     infos on format specs.  Option –color=always is supported and can
     be used safely to replace the Helm internal match highlighting.
     See ‘helm-grep-default-command’ for more infos.

‘helm-grep-default-command’

     *Standard Value*: grep –color=always -a -d skip %e -n%cH -e %p %f

     Default grep format command for ‘helm-do-grep-1’.  Where: ’%e’
     format spec is for –exclude or –include grep options or ack-grep
     –type option.  (Not mandatory)

     ’%c’ format spec is for case-fold-search, whether to use the -i
     option of grep.  (Not mandatory) When you specify this spec, helm
     grep will use smartcase that is when a upcase character is found in
     pattern case will be respected and no ’-i’ option will be used,
     otherwise, when no upcase character is found in pattern always use
     ’-i’.  If you don’t want this behavior, don’t use this spec and
     specify or not the ’-i’ option.  Note that with ack-grep this is
     not needed, just specify the ’–smart-case’ option.

     ’%p’ format spec is for pattern.  (Mandatory)

     ’%f’ format spec is for filenames.  (Mandatory)

     If your grep version doesn’t support the –exclude/include args
     don’t specify the ’%e’ format spec.

     Helm also support ack-grep and git-grep.  The following is a
     default command example for ack-grep:

     (setq helm-grep-default-command “ack-grep -Hn –color –smart-case
     –no-group %e %p %f” helm-grep-default-recurse-command “ack-grep -H
     –color –smart-case –no-group %e %p %f”)

     You can ommit the %e spec if you don’t want to be prompted for
     types.

     NOTE: Helm for ack-grep support ANSI sequences, so you can remove
     the “–no-color” option safely (recommended).  However you should
     specify –color to enable multi matches highlighting because ack
     disable it when output is piped.

     Same for grep you can use safely the option “–color=always”
     (default).  You can customize the color of matches using
     GREP_COLORS env var.  e.g: (setenv “GREP_COLORS”
     “ms=30;43:mc=30;43:sl=01;37:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36”)

     To enable ANSI color in git-grep just add “–color=always”.  To
     customize the ANSI color in git-grep, GREP_COLORS have no effect,
     you will have to setup this in your .gitconfig:

     [color “grep”] match = black yellow

     Where “black” is the foreground and “yellow” the background.  See
     the git documentation for more infos.

     ‘helm-grep-default-command’ and ‘helm-grep-default-recurse-command’
     are independent, so you can enable ‘helm-grep-default-command’ with
     ack-grep and ‘helm-grep-default-recurse-command’ with grep if you
     want to be faster on recursive grep.

     NOTE: Remote grepping is not available with ack-grep, and badly
     supported with grep because tramp handles badly repeated remote
     processes in a short delay (< to 5s).

‘helm-grep-default-recurse-command’

     *Standard Value*: grep –color=always -a -d recurse %e -n%cH -e %p
     %f

     Default recursive grep format command for ‘helm-do-grep-1’.  See
     ‘helm-grep-default-command’ for format specs and infos about
     ack-grep.

‘helm-pdfgrep-default-command’

     *Standard Value*: pdfgrep –color always -niH %s %s

     Default command for pdfgrep.  Option “–color always” is supported
     starting Helm version 1.7.8.  When used matches will be highlighted
     according to GREP_COLORS env var.

‘helm-pdfgrep-default-read-command’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Default command to read pdf files from pdfgrep.  Where ’%f’ format
     spec is filename and ’%p’ is page number.  E.g.  In Ubuntu you can
     set it to:

     “evince –page-label=%p ’%f’”

     If set to nil either ‘doc-view-mode’ or ‘pdf-view-mode’ will be
     used instead of an external command.

‘helm-pdfgrep-default-recurse-command’

     *Standard Value*: pdfgrep –color always -rniH %s %s

     Default recurse command for pdfgrep.  Option “–color always” is
     supported starting Helm version 1.7.8.  When used matches will be
     highlighted according to GREP_COLORS env var.

Command uncategorized
.....................

‘helm-grep-ag-command’

     *Standard Value*: ag –line-numbers -S –color –nogroup %s %s %s

     The default command for AG, PT or RG.

     Takes three format specs, the first for type(s), the second for
     pattern and the third for directory.

     You can use safely “–color” (used by default) with AG RG and PT.

     NOTE: Usage of “–color=never” is discouraged as it uses Elisp to
     colorize matched items which is slower than using the native
     colorization of backend, however it is still supported.

     For ripgrep here is the command line to use:

     rg –color=always –smart-case –no-heading –line-number %s %s %s

     And to customize colors (always for ripgrep) use something like
     this:

     rg –color=always –colors ’match:bg:yellow’ –colors ’match:fg:black’
     –smart-case –no-heading –line-number %s %s %s

     This will change color for matched items from foreground red (the
     default) to a yellow background with a black foreground.  Note that
     your color settings for RG will not work properly with multiples
     pattern if you have configured colors in rg config file instead of
     command line.  For more enhanced settings of ansi colors see
     <https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2313>

     You must use an output format that fit with helm grep, that is:

     “filename:line-number:string”

     The option “–nogroup” allow this.  The option “–line-numbers” is
     also mandatory except with PT (not supported).  For RG the options
     “–no-heading” and “–line-number” are the ones to use.

     When modifying the default colors of matches with e.g.
     “–color-match” option of AG or “–colors” option of ripgrep you may
     want to modify as well ‘helm-grep-ag-pipe-cmd-switches’ to have all
     matches colorized with the same color in multi match.

     Of course you can use several other options, see the man page of
     the backend you are using.

‘helm-grep-git-grep-command’

     *Standard Value*: git –no-pager grep -n%cH –color=always –full-name
     -e %p – %f

     The git grep default command line.  The option “–color=always” can
     be used safely.  The color of matched items can be customized in
     your .gitconfig See ‘helm-grep-default-command’ for more infos.

     The “–exclude-standard” and “–no-index” switches allow skipping
     unwanted files specified in ~/.gitignore_global and searching files
     not already staged (not enabled by default).

     You have also to enable this in global “.gitconfig” with “git
     config –global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global”.

‘helm-grep-actions’

     *Standard Value*:

          (("Find File" . helm-grep-action)
           ("Find file other frame" . helm-grep-other-frame)
           ("Save results in grep buffer" . helm-grep-save-results)
           ("Find file other window (C-u vertically)" . helm-grep-other-window))

     Actions for helm grep.

‘helm-grep-input-idle-delay’

     *Standard Value*: 0.1

     Idle time before updating, specified in seconds.  A lower value
     (default) means Helm will display the results faster.  Increasing
     it to a higher value (e.g.  0.6) prevents the buffer from
     flickering when updating.

‘helm-grep-max-length-history’

     *Standard Value*: 100

     Max number of elements to save in ‘helm-grep-history’.

‘helm-grep-preferred-ext’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     This file extension will be preselected for grep.

‘helm-grep-save-buffer-name-no-confirm’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     When *hgrep* already exists, auto append suffix.

‘helm-grep-truncate-lines’

     *Standard Value*: t

     When nil the grep line that appears will not be truncated.

File
....

‘helm-boring-file-regexp-list’

     *Standard Value*:

     A list of regexps matching boring files.

     This list is build by default on ‘completion-ignored-extensions’.
     The directory names should end with “_?“ e.g.  ”\.git_?” and the
     file names should end with “”.

     These regexps may be used to match the entire path, not just the
     file name, so for example to ignore files with a prefix “.bak.”,
     use “\.bak\..*$” as the regexp.

     NOTE: When modifying this, be sure to use customize interface or
     the customize functions e.g.  ‘customize-set-variable’ and NOT
     ‘setq’.

‘helm-file-globstar’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Same as globstar bash shopt option.  When non-nil a pattern
     beginning with two stars will expand recursively.  Directories
     expansion is not supported yet.

Help
....

‘helm-help-default-prompt’

     *Standard Value*: [SPC,C-v,next:ScrollUp b,M-v,prior:ScrollDown
     TAB:Cycle M-TAB:All C-s/r:Isearch q:Quit]

     The prompt used in ‘helm-help’.

‘helm-help-full-frame’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Display help window in full frame when non nil.

     Even when nil probably the same result (full frame) can be reached
     by tweaking ‘display-buffer-alist’, but it is much more convenient
     to use a simple boolean value here.

‘helm-help-hkmap’

     *Standard Value*:

          (("C-v" . helm-help-scroll-up)
           ("SPC" . helm-help-scroll-up)

           ("M-w" . helm-help-copy-region-as-kill)
           ("q" . helm-help-quit))

     Alist of (KEY .  FUNCTION) for ‘helm-help’.

     This is not a standard keymap, just an alist where it is possible
     to define a simple KEY (a string with no spaces) associated with a
     FUNCTION.  More complex key like “C-x C-x” are not supported.
     Interactive functions will be called interactively whereas other
     functions will be called with funcall except commands that are in
     ‘helm-help-not-interactive-command’.  For convenience you can add
     bindings here with ‘helm-help-define-key’.

Function
........

‘helm-describe-function-function’

     *Standard Value*: describe-function

     Function used to describe functions in Helm.

‘helm-describe-variable-function’

     *Standard Value*: describe-variable

     Function used to describe variables in Helm.

‘helm-yank-text-at-point-function’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     The function used to forward point with ‘helm-yank-text-at-point’.
     With a nil value, fallback to default ‘forward-word’.  The function
     should take one arg, an integer like ‘forward-word’.  NOTE: Using
     ‘forward-symbol’ here is not very useful as it is already provided
     by M-n.

uncategorized
.............

‘helm-advice-push-mark’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Override ‘push-mark’ with a version avoiding duplicates when
     non-nil.

‘helm-scroll-amount’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Scroll amount when scrolling other window in a helm session.  It is
     used by ‘helm-scroll-other-window’ and
     ‘helm-scroll-other-window-down’.

     If you prefer scrolling line by line, set this value to 1.

     after entering pattern.  See ’man locate’ for valid options and
     also ‘helm-locate-command’.

     You can specify a local database with prefix argument ARG.  With
     two prefix arg, refresh the current local db or create it if it
     doesn’t exists.

     To create a user specific db, use “updatedb -l 0 -o db_path -U
     directory”.  Where db_path is a filename matched by
     ‘helm-locate-db-file-regexp’.

‘helm-projects-find-files’

Fuzzy
.....

‘helm-locate-fuzzy-match’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Enable fuzzy matching in ‘helm-locate’.  Note that when this is
     enabled searching is done on basename.

‘helm-locate-fuzzy-sort-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-locate-default-fuzzy-sort-fn

     Default fuzzy matching sort function for locate.

Db
..

‘helm-ff-locate-db-filename’

     *Standard Value*: locate.db

     The basename of the locatedb file you use locally in your
     directories.  When this is set and Helm finds such a file in the
     directory from where you launch locate, it will use this file and
     will not prompt you for a db file.  Note that this happen only when
     locate is launched with a prefix arg.

‘helm-locate-db-file-regexp’

     *Standard Value*: m?locate.db$

     Default regexp to match locate database.  If nil Search in all
     files.

Command
.......

‘helm-locate-command’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of arguments for locate program.

     Helm will calculate a default value for your system on startup
     unless ‘helm-locate-command’ is non-nil.

     Here are the default values it will use according to your system:

     Gnu/linux: “locate %s -e -A –regex %s” berkeley-unix: “locate %s
     %s” windows-nt: “es %s %s” Others: “locate %s %s”

     This string will be passed to format so it should end with ‘%s’.
     The first format spec is used for the “-i” value of locate/es, so
     don’t set it directly but use ‘helm-locate-case-fold-search’ for
     this.

     The last option must be the one preceding pattern i.e “-r” or
     “–regex”.

     You will be able to pass other options such as “-b” or “l” during
     Helm invocation after entering pattern only when multi matching,
     not when fuzzy matching.

     Note that the “-b” option is added automatically by Helm when var
     ‘helm-locate-fuzzy-match’ is non-nil and switching back from
     multimatch to fuzzy matching (this is done automatically when a
     space is detected in pattern).

‘helm-locate-create-db-command’

     *Standard Value*: updatedb -l 0 -o ’%s’ -U ’%s’

     Command used to create a locale locate db file.

‘helm-locate-recursive-dirs-command’

     *Standard Value*: locate -i -e -A –regex ’^%s’ ’%s.*$’

     Command used for recursive directories completion in
     ‘helm-find-files’.

     For Windows and ‘es’ use something like “es -r ^%s.*%s.*$”

     The two format specs are mandatory.

     If for some reasons you can’t use locate because your filesystem
     doesn’t have a database, you can use find command from findutils
     but be aware that it will be much slower.  See ‘helm-find-files’
     embedded help for more infos.

uncategorized
.............

‘helm-locate-case-fold-search’

     *Standard Value*: smart

     It have the same meaning as ‘helm-case-fold-search’.  The -i option
     of locate will be used depending of value of ‘helm-pattern’ when
     this is set to ’smart.  When nil “-i” will not be used at all and
     when non-nil it will always be used.  NOTE: the -i option of the
     “es” command used on windows does the opposite of “locate” command.

‘helm-locate-project-list’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of directories, your projects.  When set, allow browsing
     recursively files in all directories of this list with
     ‘helm-projects-find-files’.

1.32.1 Modes in library ‘helm-mode’
-----------------------------------

minor-mode-p
............

‘helm-mode’

     (helm-mode &optional ARG)

     Toggle generic helm completion.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm mode’.  If the prefix
     argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

     All functions in Emacs that use ‘completing-read’,
     ‘read-file-name’, ‘completion-in-region’ and friends will use helm
     interface when this mode is turned on.

     However you can modify this behavior for functions of your choice
     with ‘helm-completing-read-handlers-alist’.

     Called with a positive arg, turn on unconditionally, with a
     negative arg turn off.  You can toggle it with M-x ‘helm-mode’.

     About ‘ido-mode’: DO NOT enable ‘ido-everywhere’ when using
     ‘helm-mode’.  Instead of using ‘ido-mode’, add the commands where
     you want to use ido to ‘helm-completing-read-handlers-alist’ with
     ‘ido’ as value.

     Note: This mode is incompatible with Emacs23.

‘C-<return>’

‘M-<RET>’ (‘helm-cr-empty-string’)

     Return empty string.

‘DEL’ (‘helm-mode-delete-char-backward-maybe’)

     Delete char backward when text is not the prefix helm is completing
     against.  First call warns user about deleting prefix completion.
     Second call deletes backward char in current-buffer and quits helm
     completion, letting the user start a new completion with a new
     prefix.

1.32.4 Options in library ‘helm-mode’
-------------------------------------

Read
....

‘helm-comp-read-case-fold-search’

     *Standard Value*: smart

     Default Local setting of ‘helm-case-fold-search’ for
     ‘helm-comp-read’.  See ‘helm-case-fold-search’ for more info.

Alist
.....

‘helm-completing-read-handlers-alist’

     *Standard Value*:

          ((find-tag . helm-completing-read-default-find-tag)
           (xref-find-definitions . helm-completing-read-default-find-tag)
           (xref-find-references . helm-completing-read-default-find-tag)
           (ggtags-find-tag-dwim . helm-completing-read-default-find-tag)
           (tmm-menubar)
           (find-file)
           (execute-extended-command)
           (dired-do-rename . helm-read-file-name-handler-1)
           (dired-do-copy . helm-read-file-name-handler-1)
           (dired-do-symlink . helm-read-file-name-handler-1)
           (dired-do-relsymlink . helm-read-file-name-handler-1)
           (dired-do-hardlink . helm-read-file-name-handler-1)
           (basic-save-buffer . helm-read-file-name-handler-1)
           (write-file . helm-read-file-name-handler-1)
           (write-region . helm-read-file-name-handler-1))

     Completing read functions for specific Emacs commands.

     By default ‘helm-mode’ use ‘helm-completing-read-default-handler’
     to provide helm completion in each ‘completing-read’ or
     ‘read-file-name’ found, but other functions can be specified here
     for specific commands.  This also allows disabling helm completion
     for some commands when needed.

     Each entry is a cons cell like (EMACS_COMMAND .
     COMPLETING-READ_HANDLER) where key and value are symbols.

     Each key is an Emacs command that use originaly ‘completing-read’.

     Each value maybe a helm function that takes same arguments as
     ‘completing-read’ plus NAME and BUFFER, where NAME is the name of
     the new helm source and BUFFER the name of the buffer we will use,
     but it can be also a function not using helm, in this case the
     function should take the same args as ‘completing-read’ and not be
     prefixed by “helm-”.

     ‘helm’ will use the name of the command calling ‘completing-read’
     as NAME and BUFFER will be computed as well with NAME but prefixed
     with “*helm-mode-”.

     This function prefix name must start by “helm-” when it uses helm,
     otherwise ‘helm’ assumes the function is not a helm function and
     expects the same args as ‘completing-read’, this allows you to
     define a handler not using helm completion.

     Example:

     (defun foo/test () (interactive) (message “%S” (completing-read
     “test: ” ’(a b c d e))))

     (defun helm-foo/test-completing-read-handler (prompt collection
     predicate require-match initial-input hist def inherit-input-method
     name buffer) (helm-comp-read prompt collection :marked-candidates t
     :name name :buffer buffer))

     (add-to-list ’helm-completing-read-handlers-alist ’(foo/test .
     helm-foo/test-completing-read-handler))

     We want here to make the regular ‘completing-read’ in ‘foo/test’
     return a list of candidate(s) instead of a single candidate.

     Note that this function will be reused for ALL the
     ‘completing-read’ of this command, so it should handle all cases.
     E.g., if first ‘completing-read’ completes against symbols and
     second ‘completing-read’ should handle only buffer, your
     specialized function should handle both.

     If the value of an entry is nil completion will fall back to Emacs
     vanilla behaviour.  Example:

     If you want to disable helm completion for ‘describe-function’,
     use:

     (describe-function .  nil)

     Ido is also supported, you can use ‘ido-completing-read’ and
     ‘ido-read-file-name’ as value of an entry or just ’ido.  Example:
     Enable ido completion for ‘find-file’:

     (find-file .  ido)

     same as

     (find-file .  ido-read-file-name)

     Note that you don’t need to enable ‘ido-mode’ for this to work, see
     ‘helm-mode’ documentation.

Mode
....

‘helm-mode-fuzzy-match’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Enable fuzzy matching in ‘helm-mode’ globally.

     This is deprecated, use instead helm-fuzzy as
     ‘helm-completion-style’ or even better ’emacs as
     ‘helm-completion-style’ and add ’flex to ‘completion-styles’
     (emacs-27) or ’helm-flex if ’flex is not available in
     ‘completion-styles-alist’ (emacs-26).

‘helm-mode-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook run after entering or leaving ‘helm-mode’.  No problems result
     if this variable is not bound.  ‘add-hook’ automatically binds it.
     (This is true for all hook variables.)

‘helm-mode-reverse-history’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Display history source after current source when non nil.

     Apply only in ‘helm-mode’ handled commands.

Completion
..........

‘helm-completion-in-region-default-sort-fn’

     *Standard Value*: helm-completion-in-region-sort-fn

     The default sort function to sort candidates in
     completion-in-region.

     When nil no sorting is done.  The function is a
     ‘filtered-candidate-transformer’ function which takes two args
     CANDIDATES and SOURCE.  The function must use the flag
     ‘helm-completion--sorting-done’ and return CANDIDATES unchanged
     when the flag is nil.  See default function
     ‘helm-completion-in-region-sort-fn’ as example.  It will be used
     only when ‘helm-completion-style’ is either Emacs or helm,
     otherwise when helm-fuzzy style is used, the fuzzy sort function
     will be used.

‘helm-completion-mark-suffix’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Push mark at end of suffix when non nil.

‘helm-completion-style’

     *Standard Value*: helm

     Style of completion to use in ‘completion-in-region’.

     This affects only ‘completion-at-point’ and friends, and the
     ‘completing-read’ using the default handler i.e.
     ‘helm-completing-read-default-handler’.

     NB: This has nothing to do with ‘completion-styles’, it is
     independent from helm, but when using ’emacs as
     helm-completion-style helm will use the ‘completion-styles’ for its
     completions.  Up to the user to configure ‘completion-styles’.

     There are three possible values to use:

        • helm, use multi match regular helm completion.

        • helm-fuzzy, use fuzzy matching.  Note that as usual when
          entering a space helm switch to multi matching mode.

        • emacs, use regular Emacs completion according to
          ‘completion-styles’.  Note that even in this style, helm
          allows using multi match.  Emacs-27 provides a style called
          ‘flex’ that can be used aside ‘helm’ style (see
          ‘completion-styles-alist’).  When ‘flex’ style is not
          available (Emacs<27) helm provides ‘helm-flex’ style which is
          similar to ‘flex’ and helm fuzzy matching.

     For a better experience, if you don’t know what to use, set
     ‘completion-styles’ to ’(flex) if you are using emacs-27 or to
     ’(helm-flex) if you are using emacs-26 and keep ’emacs as default
     value for ‘helm-completion-style’.  Advanced users can also have a
     look to ‘completion-category-overrides’ to set styles according to
     category.

     Please use custom interface or ‘customize-set-variable’ to set
     this, NOT ‘setq’.

‘helm-completion-styles-alist’

     *Standard Value*:

          ((gud-mode . helm))

     Allow configuring ‘helm-completion-style’ per mode.

     Each entry is a cons cell like (mode .  style) where style must be
     a suitable value for ‘helm-completion-style’.  When specifying
     emacs as style for a mode, ‘completion-styles’ can be specified by
     using a cons cell specifying completion-styles to use with helm
     emacs style, e.g.  (foo-mode .  (emacs helm flex)) will set
     ‘completion-styles’ to ’(helm flex) for foo-mode.  This affects
     only completions happening in buffers and not minibuffer
     completions, i.e.  completing-read’s.

‘helm-mode-handle-completion-in-region’

     *Standard Value*: t

     Whether to replace or not ‘completion-in-region-function’.  This
     enables support for ‘completing-read-multiple’ and
     ‘completion-at-point’ when non–nil.

‘helm-mode-no-completion-in-region-in-modes’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     A list of modes that do not want helm for ‘completion-in-region’.

minor-mode-p
............

‘helm-mode’

     *Standard Value*: t

     (helm-mode &optional ARG)

     Toggle generic helm completion.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm mode’.  If the prefix
     argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable
     the mode if ARG is a negative number.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it
     is disabled.

     All functions in Emacs that use ‘completing-read’,
     ‘read-file-name’, ‘completion-in-region’ and friends will use helm
     interface when this mode is turned on.

     However you can modify this behavior for functions of your choice
     with ‘helm-completing-read-handlers-alist’.

     Called with a positive arg, turn on unconditionally, with a
     negative arg turn off.  You can toggle it with M-x ‘helm-mode’.

     About ‘ido-mode’: DO NOT enable ‘ido-everywhere’ when using
     ‘helm-mode’.  Instead of using ‘ido-mode’, add the commands where
     you want to use ido to ‘helm-completing-read-handlers-alist’ with
     ‘ido’ as value.

     Note: This mode is incompatible with Emacs23.

     Note that multi1 and multi3p are incompatible with fuzzy matching
     in file completion and by the way fuzzy matching will be disabled
     there when these options are used.

‘C-x c M-s o’

‘M-s o’ (‘helm-occur’)

     Preconfigured helm for searching lines matching pattern in
     ‘current-buffer’.

     When ‘helm-source-occur’ is member of
     ‘helm-sources-using-default-as-input’ which is the default, symbol
     at point is searched at startup.

     When a region is marked search only in this region by narrowing.

     To search in multiples buffers start from one of the commands
     listing buffers (i.e.  a helm command using
     ‘helm-source-buffers-list’ like ‘helm-mini’) and use the multi
     occur buffers action.

     This is the helm implementation that collect lines matching pattern
     like vanilla Emacs ‘occur’ but have nothing to do with it, the
     search engine beeing completely different and also much faster.

‘helm-occur-right’

     ‘helm-occur’ action for right arrow.  This is used when
     ‘helm-occur-use-ioccur-style-keys’ is enabled.  If follow is
     enabled (default) go to next source, otherwise execute persistent
     action.

‘helm-occur-run-default-action’

‘helm-occur-visible-buffers’

------------------------------------

Command
.......

‘helm-top-command’

     *Standard Value*: env COLUMNS=%s top -b -n 1

     Top command used to display output of top.  A format string where
     %s will be replaced with ‘frame-width’.

     To use ’top’ command, a version supporting batch mode (-b option)
     is needed.  On Mac OSX ’top’ command doesn’t support this, so the
     ’ps’ command is used instead by default.

     Normally ’top’ command output have 12 columns, but in some versions
     you may have less than this, so you can either customize top to use
     12 columns with the interactives ’f’ and ’W’ commands of top, or
     modify ‘helm-top-sort-columns-alist’ to fit with the number of
     columns your ’top’ command is using.

     If you modify ’ps’ command be sure that ’pid’ comes in first and
     “env COLUMNS=%s” is specified at beginning of command.  Ensure also
     that no elements contain spaces (e.g., use start_time and not
     start).  Same as for ’top’: you can customize
     ‘helm-top-sort-columns-alist’ to make sort commands working
     properly according to your settings.

Poll
....

‘helm-top-poll-delay’

     *Standard Value*: 1.5

     Helm top poll after this delay when ‘helm-top-poll-mode’ is
     enabled.  The minimal delay allowed is 1.5, if less than this
     helm-top will use 1.5.

‘helm-top-poll-delay-post-command’

     *Standard Value*: 1.0

     Helm top stop polling during this delay.  This delay is added to
     ‘helm-top-poll-delay’ after Emacs stops being idle.

‘helm-top-poll-mode-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook run after entering or leaving ‘helm-top-poll-mode’.  No
     problems result if this variable is not bound.  ‘add-hook’
     automatically binds it.  (This is true for all hook variables.)

‘helm-top-poll-preselection’

     *Standard Value*: linum

     Stay on same line or follow candidate when ‘helm-top-poll’ updates
     display.  Possible values are ’candidate or ’linum.  This affects
     also sorting functions in the same way.

minor-mode-p
............

‘helm-top-poll-mode’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     (helm-top-poll-mode &optional ARG)

     Refresh automatically helm top buffer once enabled.

     If called interactively, toggle ‘Helm-Top-Poll mode’.  If the
     prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
     negative, disable the mode.

     If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is ‘toggle’.  Enable
     the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable

‘helm-top-sort-columns-alist’

     *Standard Value*:

          ((com . 11)
           (mem . 9)
           (cpu . 8)
           (user . 1))

     Allow defining which column to use when sorting output of top/ps
     command.  Only com, mem, cpu and user are sorted, so no need to put
     something else there, it will have no effect.  Note that column
     numbers are counted from zero, i.e.  column 1 is the nth 0 column.

     positions are added to ‘mark-ring’.  You can also add to register
     by using (or adding) ‘helm-save-pos-to-register-before-jump’
     instead.  In this case last position is added to the register
     ‘helm-save-pos-before-jump-register’.

‘helm-persistent-autoresize-hook’

     *Standard Value*:

‘helm-popup-tip-mode-hook’

     *Standard Value*: nil

     Hook run after entering or leaving ‘helm-popup-tip-mode’.  No
     problems result if this variable is not bound.  ‘add-hook’
     automatically binds it.  (This is true for all hook variables.)
