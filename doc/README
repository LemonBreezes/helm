Commentary about helm documentation:

This Helm branch allows installing helm info files in diverse formats
(info, html, pdf) from org files.

However there is some caveats:

1) When calling make info an arbitrary file is installed from remote
to do the job which may be unsafe if the url change for some reasons.

2) Some manuals fail to build.

3) A lot of manuals contain to much redundant infos e.g. no need to
have all docstrings repeated in diverse manuals.

4) Info files are installed in /usr/share/info by default whereas they
should be installed in /usr/local/share/info (see PREFIX).


Conclusion:

We need here a simple user manual that at least contain the same infos as
M-x helm-documentation and that build without pulling from remote
arbitrary file. In addition another manual more focused on development would be nice.
