1 Confirming bugs
*****************

To confirm that a bug is, in fact, a Helm problem, it is important to
_replicate the behavior with a minimal Emacs configuration_.  This
precludes the possibility that the bug is caused by factors outside of
Helm.

   The easiest and recommended way to do so is through the
‘emacs-helm.sh’ script.

* Menu:

* ‘emacs-helm.sh’: emacs-helmsh.
* emacs -Q::

1.1 ‘emacs-helm.sh’
===================

If your system supports it, you should run the ‘emacs-helm.sh’ script to
start an Emacs instance with minimal, Helm-specific configuration.

   This is useful for debugging, and easier than starting Emacs with
‘emacs -Q’ and configuring Helm from scratch.

   If Helm is installed via MELPA, the ‘emacs-helm.sh’ script should be
located at ‘~/.emacs.d/elpa/helm-<version>/emacs-helm.sh’.

   Of course you have to cd to your helm directory and run the script
from there, an alternative is symlinking it to somewhere in your ‘PATH’
e.g.  “~/bin” (See note at bottom for those that have installed from
source with ‘make’).

   You can use the -h argument for help:

     $ helm -h
     Usage: helm [-P} Emacs path [-h} help [--] EMACS ARGS

   If your emacs binary is not in a standard place i.e.  “emacs”, you
can specify the path with “-P”.

   ‘Note’: If you have installed Helm from Git and used ‘make && sudo
make install’ you can run directly ‘helm’ at command line from any place
i.e.  no need to cd to helm directory.

1.2 ‘emacs -Q’
==============

If you cannot run the ‘emacs-helm.sh’ script, be sure to reproduce the
problem with ‘emacs -Q’, then installing Helm as described in the
Install section.
